# What is Chaos Eclipse?
My Players' Characters, from my RPG Campaign, are **DEAD** and you must find their Lost Weapons, to know the truth about their Deaths and tell their history for the next generations, while a force from another Dimension, called the **Unknown**, is appearing out of nowhere.

Now what remains is an **Eclipse** that changes everything (TBD) and Creatures from the **Unknown** that are really Chaotic (TBD). 
> Some things should never have Left where they came from.

This Project is focused on adding tons of New Weapons and Tools, Some Blocks, More End-Game Stuff and Exploration. It's based on my own RPG, which i'm DMing for my friends, all the Features from it are References and Things that exist in the world i created.
