I spent 7 months making this, it started just as a fun little project because i was interested in modelling things from my
RPG, almost gave up because i clearly wasn't learning to code as much as i wish and i was stressing out, even it not
being the hardest thing ever to make for many, for me it was really difficult to learn to code and solve the problems.
But the Mod was only possible because of the Players from my RPG, my dearest friends, whom kept cheering me up.
